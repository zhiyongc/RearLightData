### Data Download Link: [Vehicle Rear Light Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ms8fEpXBlWMVXpPvHbWTqWiHNB6-qaJy?usp=sharing)
#### This dataset contains several videos recorded by a vehicle mounted camera. All the videos are recorded in Taipei.
#### The videos are recorded under multiple weather or light scenarios for experimental comparison. Scenariosï¼š
* Cloudy: Filename: PPG00(164-169).mov, PPG00(696-700).mov, EMG00030.mov
* Rainy: Filename: IMG_6052-1.mov
* At night: Filename: EMG00(023-031).mov
#### The recorded video frames contain real-time information as followings:
* Coordinates (lat, lon)
* Speed (km/h)
* Timestamp
